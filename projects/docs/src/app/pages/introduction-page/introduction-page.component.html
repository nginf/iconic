  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
    <code>&#64;nginf/iconic</code> (Iconic for short) is an Angular library that
    allows you to use open-source icons in your project. It has one major
    advantage over other Angular icon libraries—you can use icons as regular
    components.
  </p>

  <h1>Overview</h1>

  <p>Most icon libraries follow one of these approaches:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A generic icon component is provided, and you pass the icon name as a
      string.
    </li>
    <li>
      SVG files are placed in the public folder and registered by name using a
      registration service.
    </li>
    <li>
      A generic icon component is used, but instead of passing the name, you
      provide an SVG reference.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In our opinion, the best way to use icons in your project is to treat them
    as regular components, just like any other component. This approach has
    several advantages:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Ease of use</strong> – Icons are used like standard Angular
      components.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Full IntelliSense support</strong> – You get auto-completion and
      type safety in your IDE.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>No additional AJAX requests</strong> – Icons are loaded
      immediately, improving performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Everything in one place</strong> – The SVG and component logic are
      not separated, keeping the project structured.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Effective tree-shaking</strong> – Unused icons are removed during
      the build process, reducing bundle size.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Iconic provides this functionality by compiling popular open-source icon
    libraries into small, optimized, and fully functional Angular components.
    This means you only import the icons you need. Keep in mind that Iconic does
    not include icons itself; instead, it utilizes open-source free icons.
  </p>

  <h1>Installation</h1>

  <p>
    There is no single global installation command like
    <code>npm install iconic</code>. Instead, each icon library has its own
    installation package, allowing you to install only the libraries you need.
  </p>

  <p>For example, to install the Lucide icon library, run:</p>

  <pre><code>npm install &#64;nginf/iconic-lu</code></pre>

  <p>For Material Design icons, run:</p>

  <pre><code>npm install &#64;nginf/iconic-md</code></pre>

  <p>(See the documentation for each icon library for more details.)</p>

  <h1>Usage</h1>

  <p>
    The usage pattern is the same across all icon libraries. First, you need to
    import the appropriate icon and then use it inside your template.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, to use the <code>ChevronDown</code> icon from Lucide, your code
    would look like this:
  </p>

  <pre><code>&lt;LuChevronDown&gt;&lt;/LuChevronDown&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>
    Each icon library has its own unique prefix for components. Some libraries
    may also provide additional input properties, which are documented in their
    respective API sections.
