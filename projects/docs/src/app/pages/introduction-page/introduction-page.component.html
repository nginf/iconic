  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
    <code>&#64;nginf/iconic</code> ( <code>iconic</code> for short) is an
    Angular library that allows you to use open-source icons in your project. It
    has one major advantage over other Angular icon libraries—you can use icons
    as regular components.
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>Most icon libraries follow one of these approaches:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A generic icon component is provided, and you pass the icon name as a
      string.
    </li>
    <li>
      SVG files are placed in the public folder and registered by name using a
      registration service.
    </li>
    <li>
      A generic icon component is used, but instead of passing the name, you
      provide an SVG reference.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In our opinion, the best way to use icons in your project is to treat them
    as regular components, just like any other component. This approach has
    several advantages:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Ease of use</strong> – Icons are used like standard Angular
      components.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Full IntelliSense support</strong> – You get auto-completion and
      type safety in your IDE.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>No additional AJAX requests</strong> – Icons are loaded
      immediately, improving performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Everything in one place</strong> – The SVG and component logic are
      not separated, keeping the project structured.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Effective tree-shaking</strong> – Unused icons are removed during
      the build process, reducing bundle size.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Iconic provides this functionality by compiling popular open-source icon
    libraries into small, optimized, and fully functional Angular components.
    This means you only import the icons you need.
  </p>

    Keep in mind that Iconic does not provide its own crafted icons; instead, it
    utilizes open-source free icons.
  </p>
  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>
    There is no single global installation command like
    <code>npm install iconic</code>. Instead, each icon library has its own
    installation package, allowing you to install only the icon library you
    need.
  </p>

  <p>For example, to install the Lucide icon library, run:</p>

  <pre><code>npm install &#64;nginf/iconic-lu</code></pre>

  <p>And you are good to go!</p>

  <p>(See the documentation for each icon library for more details.)</p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>

  <p>
    The usage pattern is the same across all icon libraries. First, you need to
    import the appropriate icon and then use it inside your template.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, to use the <code>ChevronDown</code> icon from Lucide, your code
    would look like this:
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>{{ usageCode }}</code>
  </pre>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Icon class names always have the
      <code>Icon</code>
      suffix.
    </li>
    <li>
      Icon selectors always have the
      <code>icon</code>
      suffix.
    </li>
    <li>
      Rarely, Some icon names start with a number, which is not a valid class
      name or selector. In such cases, a library-specific prefix is added. For
      example, in Font Awesome, the
      <code>0.svg</code>
      icon would be generated as the
      <code>fa0Icon</code>
      component with the selector
      <code>fa-0-icon</code>
      .
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Each icon library has its own unique prefix for components. Some libraries
    may also provide additional input properties, which are documented in their
    respective API sections.

  <div class="not-prose">
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-6">
      @for(library of iconLibraries;track $index){
      <a
        [routerLink]="library.path"
        class="rounded-md shadow-md px-3 py-4 gap-4 flex hover:bg-slate-100 items-center bg-slate-50 w-full"
      >
        <img
          [src]="library.logo"
          [alt]="library.name + ' logo'"
          width="30"
          height="30"
        />
        <p class="font-medium text-2xl text-center">
          {{ library.name }}
        </p>
